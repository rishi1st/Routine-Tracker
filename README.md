# Routine-Tracker
This routine tracker project enables users to track their daily activities by interacting with a grid layout of boxes, each representing a day of the month. The functionality includes:

1. **Click to Mark Completion**: Users can click on a box to indicate that they have completed their routine for that specific day.

2. **Persistent State**: The state of the clicked boxes is stored locally in the user's browser using the browser's local storage mechanism. This ensures that even if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the browser, the marked boxes will retain their completion status.

3. **Single Box Per Day**: To maintain the integrity of the tracking system, users can only mark one box per day. If they attempt to mark more than one box, an alert will notify them that only one box can be checked per day.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Once a box is clicked, it remains visually highlighted, indicating its completion status. Additionally, a Font Awesome checkmark icon is displayed within the clicked box, providing a visual cue of completion.

5. **Responsive Layout**: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal display across various screen sizes and devices, thereby enhancing user experience and accessibility.

Overall, this project provides a simple yet effective solution for users to track their daily routines, offering convenience, persistence, and visual feedback to enhance usability and engagement.
